Singapore can expect more rain and less haze in the coming weeks with the south-west monsoon season transitioning into inter-monsoon conditions.

The inter-monsoon season typically lasts from October to November and the weather during the period is characterised by more rainfall and light and variable winds.

The Meteorological Service Singapore said on Monday in an advisory that this transition signals the end of traditional dry season in the region, and the likelihood of transboundary haze affecting Singapore for the rest of the year will be low.

This is because the increased rainfall will help alleviate the hotspot and haze situation in Sumatra and Kalimantan in Indonesia.
