Train services between Admiralty and Jurong East MRT stations will end half an hour earlier from Sunday, Nov 2, to end March next year, due to rail works.

SMRT will end services at nine North-South Line stations by 12.30am on Sunday to Thursday nights, except on the eve of public holidays.

The stations are: Admiralty, Woodlands, Marsiling, Kranji, Yew Tee, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Gombak, Bukit Batok and Jurong East.

From Nov 2, commuters who board trains after 11.15pm on the North-South Line are advised to plan their journey and consider alternative transport arrangements such as bus services to get to their final destination, said SMRT in a statement to remind the public on Monday.
